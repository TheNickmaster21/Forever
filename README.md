# Forever

This is a project I created to expirement with explicit client-server replication via scripts, rendering content locally on the client, and allowing 
huge game maps via only storing map data on the server as opposed to actual instances. There are a lot of things I want to experiment with moving forward
including but not limited to: terrain chunking, more advanced world generation, full voxel terrain, and server validation of client movement.

This project uses [roblox-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roblox-ts) and my library [@rbxts/crochet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/crochet).

You can find the experience [published on Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/9764949792/Forever).
